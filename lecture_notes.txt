Labs voluntarily
Take home exam: over summer (!)
Home assignment deadlines: 5/5, 26/5 & 9/6

Simulations can be used to confirm developed analytical models
Different kind of systems:
	Continuous
	Discrete
	Hybrid
	Dynamic - time dependent
	Stochastic 
Verification vs. validation
	ver = test your model, does your program work as the model you developed with simple tests
	val = sanity checks?
Model concepts, slide 16
Random generate points of measurements: 
	Takes time to write to file
	How much data is desired?

Lecture 2, 23/3
Event scheduling method
	Smaller problems
	Also event-listing, this is how the events+times are stored
	Cf. queue and scheduling of departure and arrivals, but you need an initialisation trigger/kick-start.
	Events are times at which an action takes place, in this case arrival/departure.
		These events are stored in an ordered list wrt time.
Process-interaction method, slide 21
	Object orientation, process = object
	Use signal communication
	Matrix to keep track of event-list (2nd dimension = the process' signal list)
	Steps of constructing the process interaction : slide 39!
	Should read up upon the implementation of this method

Measurements:
	Be careful of biased measurements -> randomise times -> central limit theorem --> mean(process)

Lecture 3, 28/2
Verification
	Animation tools for discrete event simulations
	Comparison with analytical results (Little's theorem)
Pseudo-random numbers: deterministic sequence of numbers which "are random". Common: congruential generators.
Inverse CDF method for random numbers according to a probability distribution.
	Gaussian distr. Approximate inverse. If accuracy is important, examine the method to generated the distr. 

Error propagation:
	errors in input
	Standard error prop. holds: DeltaX << X

Lecture 4, 4/4
Mean is an unbiased estimator!
Use confidence intervals -> update during runtime and plot for better interpretation.
Warmup time: lag before the system reaches a steady state -> need to postpone measurements! Observe the properties of what you'd like to measure first. 
Confidence intervals implies data is uncorrelated. Always check if there is a correlation in the system.
Correlations can be calculated continuously during a run ...
Manipulating measurement frequency can improve correlation
Batch means - group your data and take means from these group as the measurements
FOR MORE STATISTICS:
Another good book that deals much more with the statistical side of discrete event simulation is:

Lecture 5, 6/4
Two options for simulations:
	Study behaviour
	Get optimal solution
Convex optimisation problem?
Combinatorial search -> discrete time space
Linear programming: Optimisation of linear problem (linear function)
Feasible region: region within which solutions exist
LP: solution is on a corner point!
